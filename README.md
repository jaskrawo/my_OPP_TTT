AI Tic-Tac-Toe based on reinforcement learning. The moves it choses are dependent on the results of previous games.
Sequences of moves that lead to victory get points, thus there will be a higher chance choosing these moves in the future games.
Accordingly moves that ended in the losing state will be chosen less frequently.
